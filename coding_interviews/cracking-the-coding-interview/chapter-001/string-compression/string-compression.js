// String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.
// For example, the string `aabcccccaaa` would become `a2b1c5a3`.
// If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string.
// You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z)
