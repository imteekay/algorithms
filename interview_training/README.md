# Interview Traning

## Tech Interview Preparation

### [Before the interview](http://blog.gainlo.co/index.php/2017/02/18/chapter-1-get-interview-google-complete-guide-google-interview-preparation/)

- Referral Is The Core
    - Talk to some friends at this Tech companies
- Resume
    - Concise and easy to understand
    - Single page
    - Balance between details and simplicity
    - Clear to anyone without relevant background and at the same time give people some ideas about the complexity
    - Review and feedback
- Technical Questions
    - Draw an example:
        - Specific. It should use real numbers or strings (if applicable to the problem).
        - Sufficiently large. Most examples are too small, by about 50%.
        - Not a special case. Be careful. It's very easy to inadvertently draw a special case. If there's any way your example is a special case (even if you think it probably won't be a big deal), you should fix it.

### [Build a Solid Foundation](http://blog.gainlo.co/index.php/2017/02/24/chapter-2-build-solid-foundation-complete-guide-google-interview-preparation/)

Some questions to have in mind:

- How to do a search in a graph? What are the pros and cons of each approach? How to decide which one to use?
- For a list of objects, you can use linked list, array, stack, queue and other data structures. How would you decide which one to use? What is the biggest advantage/disadvantage?
- What’s the difference between dynamic programming and recursion? How do you compare a recursive solution and its iterative version?
- If I want to improve my solution from O(n^2) time complexity to O(nlogn), what algorithms come to your mind? How about O(n)?

Build the the foundation by learning the fundamental algorithms and data structures:

- Fundamental Algorithms
    - [ ] Sorting: merge, quick, bucket, heap, counting
    - [ ] Searching: Binary Search, Depth First Search, Breadth First Search
    - [ ] Dynamic Programming
    - [ ] String / Array: reverse
    - [ ] Linked list: insertion, deletion
- Fundamental Data Structures
    - [ ] Stack
    - [ ] Queue
    - [ ] Linked List
    - [ ] Array
    - [ ] Hash Map
    - [ ] Graph
    - [ ] Tree
- Complexity
    - [ ] Space complexity for all algorithms / data structures
    - [ ] Runtime complexity for all algorithms / data structures
    - [ ] Make comparisons between algorithms and data structures
